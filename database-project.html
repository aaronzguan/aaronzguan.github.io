								<p id="overview">I've taken ECSE421-Database System course at McGill University and the project of this course required students to develop and build a database application for a real-world domain. We designed a schema, created a database using PostgreSQL, populated our database with data, maintained, queried and updated our data, developed application programs, and implemented a user-friendly interface by Java.</p>
								<p>Our group's application is an online platform for users to purchase or sell their electronics products. The application allows both buyer and seller to register as the user. The seller can open stores to sell electronic devices and the buyer can purchase products based on shopping cart module. The database is build based on the basic function including querying products, adding to the shopping cart, and performing payment, etc. Actually, we used TaoBao as a reference and we limit our sphere of interest to electronics sales website and consider C2C E-commerce application.</p>

								<h6><i><li>Data Modification</li></i></h6>
                                    
                                    <p><code>DELETE</code> and <code>UPDATE</code> are usually used to modify the data in the database.</p><p><code>CREATE VIEW</code> is used to create virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.</p> 
                                    <p><code>CHECK</code> constraint is used to limit the value range that can be placed in a column.</p>
                                    For example:
                                    <pre><code>-- Update the payment state of orders to unpaid 
which created after year 2017 and with total amount greater than 50.

-- Delete the store which opened before year 2017
DELETE FROM save_to_shopping_cart

                                    <h6><i><li>Procedural Statements</li></i></h6>
                                    <p>Stored procedure and user-defined function (UDF) is a set of SQL and procedural statements (declarations, assignments, loops, flow-of-control etc.) that stored on the database server and can be invoked using the SQL interface. In PostgreSQL, both stored procedures and user-defined functions are created with <code>CREATE FUNCTION</code>statement.</p>
                                    <p>The stored procedure we designed is to compute the average amount of a brand in the <i>'product'</i> and then use this value to modify the quantity of a product in <i>'save_to_shopping_cart'</i> table.</p>
                                    <pre><code>-- STORED PROCEDURE
CREATE FUNCTION func1 (vpid integer, vbrand character varying) RETURNS integer
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
v_amount INTEGER;
C1 CURSOR FOR SELECT AVG(amount) FROM product WHERE brand = vbrand;
BEGIN
OPEN C1;
FETCH C1 INTO v_amount;
UPDATE save_to_shopping_cart SET quantity = v_amount WHERE pid = vpid;
RETURN v_amount;
CLOSE C1;
END
$$</code></pre>
                                    <p>Use <code>SELECT</code> to invoke the stored procedure. For example: <code>SELECT fun1(8,'Microsoft')</code> will return the average amount of the Microsoft products in the <i>'product'</i> table and also update the quantity of the product whose pid is 8 in the <i>'save_to_shopping_cart'</i> table.</p>
								<p>We also created a trigger associated with this procedure. Whenever the quantity of a product in the <i>'save_to_shopping_cart'</i> changes, we will log it into a separate table named <i>'shoppingcart_audits'</i> by this trigger.</p>
								<p>First, we created the <i>'shoppingcart_audits'</i> table and the trigger function.</p>
								<pre><code>-- TRIGGER PROCEDURE
CREATE TABLE shoppingcart_audits(
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
userid INT NOT NULL,
pid INT NOT NULL,
quantity INT NOT NULL,
changed_on TIMESTAMP(6) NOT NULL
);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION shoppingcart_quantity_changes()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
IF NEW.quantity &lt;&gt; OLD.quantity THEN
INSERT INTO shoppingcart_audits (userid, pid, quantity,changed_on)
VALUES ( OLD.userid, OLD.pid, OLD.quantity, now());
END IF;
RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';</code></pre>
								<p>Second, we bind the trigger function to the <i>'save_to_shopping_cart'</i> table by <code>CREATE TRIGGER</code>. Whenever the quantity is updated in the shopping cart, the trigger function would be automatically invoked to store the changes to the <i>'shoppingcart_audits'</i> table.</p>
								<pre><code>CREATE TRIGGER quantity_changes
BEFORE UPDATE
ON save_to_shopping_cart
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE shoppingcart_quantity_changes();</code></pre>
								</ol>

                                <!-- JAVA GUI -->
                                <h2 id="javaGUI">Java GUI</h2>
                                <p>We have created GUI for our database by Java. I am going to show you some functions and go through a little bit about our GUI.</p>
								<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">

									<h6><i><li>Connect to Database</li></i></h6>
									<p>Before we perform any query to database, we need to make sure the connection with database is built in java. PostgreSQL JDBC Driver is required to do so. After downloading from <a href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html">PostgreSQL JDBC Driver</a>, dropping it into the classpath and following the below codes can successfully build the connection.</p>
									<pre><code>public class SQL {
    Statement statement;
    public SQL() throws SQLException{
        try {
            DriverManager.registerDriver ( new org.postgresql.Driver() ) ;
		} catch (Exception cnfe){
            System.out.println("Class not found");
            }	 
        String url = "jdbc:postgresql://comp421.cs.mcgill.ca:5432/cs421"; //The IP address of your database
        Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection (url, "Username", "Password") ;
        statement = con.createStatement (ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE,ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE ) ;
        System.out.println("Build connection with database successfully");
}</code></pre>
                                    <p>Create a statement object so we can submit SQL statements to the driver. <code>Statement statement = con.createStatement();</code></p>
									<p>How to pass the SQL statement from java to database? The answer is mentioned above — statement object. But there are two different kinds of situation. First, you may perform data modification for the database and do not expect any value returned from it, such as <code>update</code>and <code>delete</code>. Second, you may perform query which would return the data from database. Two corresponding methods in java are shown below:</p>
									<pre><code>public void WriteExcute(String sqlCode){
    try {
        statement.executeUpdate ( sqlCode ) ;
        System.out.println("Write excute the code "+sqlCode);
    } catch (SQLException e){
        int errorCode = e.getErrorCode(); // Get SQLCODE
        String sqlState = e.getSQLState(); // Get SQLSTATE     
        System.out.println("Code: " + sqlCode + "  sqlState: " + sqlState);
    }
}
		
public java.sql.ResultSet QueryExchte(String sqlCode){ 
    java.sql.ResultSet rs = null;
    try {
        rs = statement.executeQuery (sqlCode ) ;
        System.out.println("Query excute the code "+sqlCode);
    } catch (SQLException e){
        int errorCode = e.getErrorCode(); // Get SQLCODE
        String sqlState = e.getSQLState(); // Get SQLSTATE     
        System.out.println("Code: " + sqlCode + "  sqlState: " + sqlState);
        }
    return rs; //rs contains the results of the execution of a query

									<p>Actually, different functions, including Login, Search products, Purchase, and Delivery, are all achieved by executing different SQL statements in the application. We used Swing and AWT to create each user-friendly frame. The working flow of our application is shown below:</p>
